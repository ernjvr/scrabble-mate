# scrabble-mate
A fun word building game to help improve your English vocabulary and spelling. A player is given 15 random scrambled letters. The challenge is to construct a valid correctly-spelled English dictionary word using those letters.  Each of the 15 letters may only be used once to construct a word.   If player uses same letter more than once, no points will be awarded and game will move to the next round. The player does not have to use all 15 letters to construct a word. The player can use hyphens and/or apostrophes. 1 point per letter is awarded per correctly spelled word. Blank spaces will be ignored by the program, and only consider the first entered word before white space. If two or more words are entered seperated by white space, only the first word will be considered and scored. The rest wil be ignored. A player may not use any letter that is not part of the 15 randomly-generated letters presented to the player for that round. Hyphens and apostrophes are not awarded any points. The longer the constrcuted word, the more points are awarded to the player. The game will present the player with a User Interface. A game will consist of 10 rounds.
